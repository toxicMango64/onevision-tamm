# Tammathon 2025

## Our solution model to all the tasks for the Taamathon 2025

This text outlines an AI challenge focused on **developing a cat facial recognition model** to help reunite lost pets with their owners in the UAE, where many go missing annually despite existing identification methods. Participants are tasked with **training a machine learning model** using provided datasets of cat images to accurately identify individual cats based on their unique facial features. Submissions will be evaluated using **Top-3 Accuracy**, requiring participants to submit the top three predicted identities for each test image in a specific CSV format. The competition includes **public and private leaderboards**, submission limits, and a requirement for code sharing and reproducibility, emphasizing original work in leveraging AI for pet identification.
